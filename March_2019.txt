Ticket from Gareth regarding specific wells not showing data. 
Miseq run. Lots of pressure today. My project is live and as expected there are issues. They need to be dealt with now, otherwise they are going to be in the way of the labs work. I am enjoying the pressure a lot however and apparently I am quite capable of working in such conditions. I found the bug and sorted it out within a few hours.

Ticket from Gareth regarding experiments not going through properly from the latest run.
Ticket from Gareth regarding the graphs being off all over the system
That one was a bigger bug. Basically the whole system was projecting wrong data. David almost proposed we roll back the deployment. 
However with Peter's help the bug was found within hours and the system was fixed.
Lots of pressure, but again, I have to say I am enjoying the past few days a lot.

Gareth asked for 0 bar on graph to be red and graphs to show percentage rather than actual numbers.
I managed to work through this one today. Its done and its waiting to be deployed on the next sprint. This week has been very productive.

Peter put out a ticket in regards to importing a few more data into the database. That is relevant to my migration project and since I feel like I will probably have to go back to it again over the next week(new user requirements/bugs), I decided to pick the ticket up and try to deal with it fast.



07-03-2019

Working on importing quality data, its more complicated than expected since the reference sequence is also needed. 
Had to go back and import that too.
David came by and we discussed about the ML project. After consulting with Andrew too, he suggested we use the data imported to the database on my migration project and build an unsupervised model that works for that dataset.
That is a great development since I can avoid going through the ML project of the previous placement student, which was a big challenge this far.

08-03-2019

Done with quality
David suggested that he might be able to offer me a short contract at the end of my 1 year, if I need some extra time with ML.
This week has been productive and him suggesting that was incredible. I am more motivated than ever to tackle my new project starting Monday.
I am all done with every other project I have had and I can finally be 100% committed to the ML project.

Been doing research on ML. I decided that I am going to record all the interesting material I come up with regarding ML and list it at the end of the month. This should help me keep track of my learning and allow me to better reflect on it afterwards.

I have began to have a better idea of what I am planning to do with my project. I decide to start working on extracting a good dataset from our database.

Decided I am going to create multiple models and see how each of them does against my dataset.
