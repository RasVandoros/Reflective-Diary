I think I will work on self organizing maps as part of my Machine Learning project. I would like to see what I could find out about my dataset using them.

Career Planning Seminar.

Learned a lot about how to handle my career and plan ahead. 
Created a plan for the next 2 years of my career and thought about the means to achieve my goals.

After working on SOMS for a few days I have come up with a model showing patterns within the data. For the following few days I will try to create models using multiple algorithms including:
-K-means clustering
-Hierarchical Clustering
-t-SNE clustering
-DBSCAN Clustering

Today I will start my work with K-means clustering.

Wrapping up my models created this far. I have been able to produce some resuts using K-means clustering and Hierchical Clustering. It would be wise if I could contact the lab and have a chat about my results. Next week I am planning to move to t-SNE Clustering and DBSCAN Clustering.

Introduction to Powerful Presentations seminar on campus.
Maybe the best seminar I have attended. Had to create a presentation beforehand. Presented to the rest of the group, on camera and then received feedback.

Datasets and hyper-parameter tuning for the models I created over the past few weeks. Had  to clean up my data and introduce a few ideas to normalize things a bit.
