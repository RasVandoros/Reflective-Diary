While searching through the project for bugs I found out that there is an issue with empty experiments handling. When empty experiments exist, the system should not be breaking, but rather it should be able to handle it. Ideally then new experiments should not show up at all and a message should inform the devs about the existence of blank experiments on the console. This way it should be better for both the users and the developers.

Merged with a different project that has been running alongside my development. The other project is dealing with crispr highlighting within the miseq allele frequency tables. Not too many conflicts between the two projects fortunately.

Now that the new data has been imported to the database, the decision has been made to alter one of the Lims2-Scripts scripts that was being used to calculate the frameshift of the newly imported experiments. The new functionality that will be added will aim to import specific miseq_plates. New miseq plates data will be getting imported, while rerunning older plates will be updating the existing data by deleting the old data and uploading the new versions from the warehouse.
