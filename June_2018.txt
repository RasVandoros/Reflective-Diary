First day today. I was introduced to the rest of the team and my workspace. My line manager Peter took me through my equipment and helped me set everything up.

Spent as much time as possible with the rest of the team, getting to know them. Everyone made me feel welcome and part of the team.

Spent time with Peter and David, the team manager, in the restaurant where they explained to me the hierarchy of the teams that work within the company. That was very helpful since it gave me a more whole understanding of the way the production and decision process takes place within Sanger.

All my equipment is now set up. Peter introduced me to a series of tutorials which would help me familiarise myself with the tools need for the job. My first task was to finish a bash tutorial. Eventhough I had a basic knowledge of bash being asked to do the tutorial was great because it made me feel more comfortable. Working on a mac computer for the first time was also a challenge for me and I appreciated taking 1 day getting familiar with that and bash before moving forward. Attended Machine learning in large-scale single cell genomics talk in the campus, by Professor Fabian Theis.

Today we attended a seminar called Visualization of Biological Data for Research and outreach by prof. Sean O'Donoghue. It was very informative and helped me gain a better understanding of the biology aspect of my new job. Seeing how the visualization of the data is performed was also very interesting and made me consider if I could follow a similar path with my machine learning project later on.
